# Gamebuino META Screen Recorder

With this tool, you'll be able to record your Gamebuino META screen while running an application. Recording can be done in standard (`80x64`) or high (`160x128`) resolution. The display data on the screen is sent to the serial port via a USB cable. This data is received by a PHP script that rebuilds the frames one by one and saves them in PNG files. You can then create an animated GIF with ImageMagick from the saved PNG files.
